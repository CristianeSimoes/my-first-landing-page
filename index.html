      <h2>All Roads Lead to Code!</h2>
      <p>
        There are three ways you can become a Web Developer. The most
        traditional one is to pursue a college degree, which can take 3 to 4
        years. But if you already have a degree or are eager to start working,
        you can choose to attend a Bootcamp or an Academy. These options are
        excellent for accelerating your learning and preparing you for the job
        market.

              Another option is to explore the world of coding as a self-taught
              individual, by taking online courses, watching tutorials on
              YouTube, and participating in challenges and hackathons.

              No matter which path you choose, having a portfolio with at least
              3 robust projects will be essential. You will find these and many
              more tips in our e-books.
